# Google Cloud Vision and Matplotlib Integration Notebook

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the integration of Google Cloud Vision API with Python to perform image analysis tasks, such as text and label detection. It also highlights the potential use of the matplotlib library for visualizing data, although specific examples of visualization are not fully implemented in the provided notebook.

## Features

- **Text Detection**: Implements functions to use Google Cloud Vision for detecting and extracting text from images. This is particularly useful for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) applications where extracting printed or handwritten text from images is required.
- **Label Detection**: Demonstrates how to identify descriptive labels in images that categorize or describe the image content, such as detecting labels like 'Flower', 'Petal', etc. This function can be used for content-based image retrieval or automatic metadata generation.
- **Potential Data Visualization**: The notebook imports matplotlib, suggesting a potential for future implementation of visualizing the analysis results directly within the notebook.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- An active Google Cloud account with the Vision API enabled

### Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the notebook directory. Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install notebook matplotlib google-cloud-vision
